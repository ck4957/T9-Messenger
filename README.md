# T9 Messenger

! [T9](T9.png)
The goal of the project is to get familiarized with the WPF framework, using the MVVM design pattern, event drivenprogramming, and built in data structures for .NET

Messenger has two modes:
1. Predictive
- It allows words to be formed by a single keypress for each letter, as opposed to the multi-tap approach used in conventional mobile phone text entry

2. Non-Predictive
- Multiple clicks of a button will result in a change of the letter.
